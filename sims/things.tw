<<if $done_fridge>>There's a beautiful [[leather chair|ChairVisit]] in the corner of the furniture department.<<endif>>

::A charming lamp
You bravely walk up and begin examining the lamp. It's a squat table lamp, about two feet tall with a paunchy olive base and a tasteful, if dorky, beige shade. 
An [[informative label]] hangs from its neck.

::informative label
The label says this is a "Timothy Table Lamp." Apparently it's a Gushing \
Meadows native- designed and manufactured on the Clarkson's Home Furnishing \
campus.  Reading the note you learn more about the Clarkson company and its \
role in the history of Gushing Meadows. The "Timothy Table Lamp" is part of a \
long line of local table lamps. For almost a hundred years Clarkson's table \
lamps have been lighting the homes of the good people of Gushing Meadows, and \
they hope to continue to do so for as long as they can.

::strange white box
The box, rounded at the corners and slightly bigger than a person, seems to have a door on the front.

[[open the door]]

::open the door
You swing the door open and!! The box is cold and filled with food. There are so many kinds of food in here.
There are hoagies wrapped in plastic bags, styrofoam containers filled with chicken parmesan, take out containers of chinese food.
A world of sinful opportunities unfurls before your eyes. You had never really considered the vast possibilities of culinary delight available to you.

You pierce a bulging grape with your canine tooth and let the juice slide down your throat. The feeling of cold liquid sliding down you makes you shiver.
<<then>>\
With careful precision you bind a nugget of orange chicken with a rope of chow mein. You dangle it above your mouth and let the syrup drip into your mouth before gobbling it up whole.
<<then>>\
Over the course of several encounters you savor a piece of devils food cake. Each time you split it in half, foolishly thinking that you can keep your affair going indefinitely by infinitely subdividing your affections.
When you eat the second to last unsatisfying sliver you spitefully devour the last morsel. This proves to you that the only sustianable culinary model is constant motion.

After listlessly sucking a Baby Ruth down to the nougat you look back on your previous meals and feel that the time has come to give up your wandering ways. <<set $done_fridge = true>>

::ChairVisit
<<first>>
    Your eyes instinctively dart away, afraid of your habit of staring. The glance leaves an incomplete form in your imagination: a shiny brown shape, impossible welcoming curves, plush but firm cusions. \
    You approach carefully, pretending to examine a hideous green courduroy recliner. You audibly scoff and curse while fumbling with the recliner lever, then transfer to the chair. \
    You circle the chair exactly once, slowly. You don't want to seem timid or unsure. \
    You run your index finger along the ridge of the chair's back and your finger neither sticks nor chafes. You gently prod the armrest. Adrenaline shoots through your body when you start to sit in it. You decide there's no reason to rush.

    You gain 40 thing need.
    <<run atrophy_needs()>>\
    <<run add_need("thing_need", 40)>>\
<<then>>
    You cordially approach the chair and sit down in it with your back straight. You bounce up and down a bit to test its give. You aren't sure what to do with your hands so you set them on the armrests. \
    You suddenly feel very self conscious. You are worried that you have made a mistake and this might not be the chair for you. \
    Another customer walks up, nods and smiles at the chair. You walk away. You are sure this other customer is going to buy the chair and live a happy life with it.

    You feel despondent. You lose 10 thing need.
    <<run atrophy_needs()>>\
    <<run add_need("thing_need", -10)>>\
<<then>>
    The chair is still here! The other customer did not buy it. You decide to not waste any more time and welcome the chair into your home.
